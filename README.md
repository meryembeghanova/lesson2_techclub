Homework
1) Personal Time Capsule
   My prompt for this task was: I am a beginner Python student. I need to create a program called Personal Time Capsule that:

Asks the user 8–9 questions about their current life

Uses f-strings for nice formatting

Saves the answers into a text file named time_capsule_2026.txt

Adds today’s date automatically at the top

Includes a line that says “To be opened in: [future date]”

Has clear borders and sections in the output

Please provide a simple, well-structured Python solution suitable for homework and explain how the future date line is added.

While working in this projects I learned: 1) How to use f-strings to format text in a clean and readable way

2) How to work with files using with open() to write data into a .txt file

3) How to use Python’s datetime module to get today’s date automatically

4) How to structure text with borders and sections to make output look organized
   This project helped me practice combining multiple concepts (inputs, strings, dates, and files) into one complete program. It made me more confident in writing longer Python programs and understanding how real programs store information.
