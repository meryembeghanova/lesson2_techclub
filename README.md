Homework
1) Personal Time Capsule
   My prompt for this task was: I am a beginner Python student. I need to create a program called Personal Time Capsule that:

Asks the user 8–9 questions about their current life

Uses f-strings for nice formatting

Saves the answers into a text file named time_capsule_2026.txt

Adds today’s date automatically at the top

Includes a line that says “To be opened in: [future date]”

Has clear borders and sections in the output

Please provide a simple, well-structured Python solution and explain how the future date line is added.

While working in this projects I learned: 
1) How to use f-strings to format text in a clean and readable way

2) How to work with files using with open() to write data into a .txt file

3) How to use Python’s datetime module to get today’s date automatically

4) How to structure text with borders and sections to make output look organized

  


2.Calculator with memomry from this task i learned: Appending to files, generating timestamps, and formating numbers.The most challenging part was ensuring the timestamp matched the exact format required by the assignment. By combining these three skills, I can now create programs that "remember" user activity across different sessions

3) I chose to create Weekly goals Tracker.
   At first AI did not understand the "quote" part each time the code runs there would be the same motivational quote.But after I wrote: “Create a list of motivational quotes and use Python to randomly choose one each time the program runs.” and after this prompt chatgpt made everything clearly and correct.

    This project helped me practice basic Python skills like:
lists, loops, conditions, and files.

I am happy that I can run the program and get a real file with my weekly goals.



The most interesting thing I learned from this lesson was to create and learn timestamps and appending.
